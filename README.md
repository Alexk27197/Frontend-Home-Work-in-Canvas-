## Features 🛠

- **Six Unique Figures**: Each figure represents a unique design and approach, highlighting the flexibility of the Canvas API.
- **Pure Vanilla JS**: The figures were created using pure JavaScript, ensuring lightweight and efficient rendering.
- **Responsive**: While the figures themselves are static, the surrounding webpage is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used 🚀

- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for drawing graphics on the fly via scripting (JavaScript).
- **CSS**: For styling and presentation purposes.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic elements and manages the drawing on the canvas.

## How it Works ⚙️

1. **Canvas Element**: An HTML canvas element is positioned on the webpage.
2. **JavaScript**: Using JavaScript, the canvas context is fetched, which provides various methods to draw shapes, paths, text, and more.
3. **Figures**: Six distinct figures are drawn using methods like `moveTo()`, `lineTo()`, `arc()`, and more.
4. **Styling**: CSS is applied to position the canvas and ensure that the webpage is responsive.
